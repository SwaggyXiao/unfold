# About

Unfold is a mental heath app that helps people overcome the lack of communication during and after the pandemic. "Unfold" aims to provide a healing community for expressing feelings safely. You will encounter friends through anonymous letters and embrace every unique person with a sincere heart.


## Why different compare to the traditional therapy?
Compared to traditional 1-to-1 therapy, emotions in Unfold are shared in the community. An artificial intelligence-based recommendation system is used in our application. It selects three different letters from other users that sent out each day. These letters can be short story, emotional quotes, or a personal experience. From reading the letters, our user might smile, laugh, or even have a drop of tears. Emotion will resonance long after the reading, and this provides an emotional catharsis for our users.

## Here's how this app works.
### 1. Express 🙋
Does your mind fall apart from time to time? Do you have trouble opening up to people? Write a letter about what's bothering you and send it out. There will be a warm soul waiting to cheer you up or warm someone else with your soul.

### 2. Your personal AI therapist 🩺
Understand your mood by chatting with the AI, which is not just your buddy, but also automatically assesses your mental state and provides appropriate advice through the conversation. As the AI becomes more familiar with you, the greater the likelihood that you will receive the “right” letter.

### 3. Stay on top of your heart ☝️

There are times when we just have too much to do. Unfold uses advanced algorithms to feel your heart and translate elusive emotions into easy-to-read charts and data. See for yourself how your positive energy increases day by day and work with you to take back control of your life again.
