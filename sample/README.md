# Text-based emotion analysis

This is a set of experiments carried out to understand the following effects on the overall performance of an emotion recognition system from short, informal English text.

## Data
- nunber of classes
- data distribution of each class
	- feature representations using n-gram, where n is 1 to 10
	- logistic regression vs neural network
- neural network topology
	- number of neurons
	- number of hidden layers

## Result

	- This image shows the results of a conversation through text-based emotion analysis

	- This graph shows the difference in emotions in the conversation between the patient who received counseling for the first time and the patient who received counseling for the fourth time.
	- We can clearly see that in the fourth conversation, the patient expressed significantly less negative emotions verbally.
	- By recognizing patterns, we can open up supervised learning, allowing the AI to learn the user's psychology and design our recommendation algorithm with the goal of reducing negative inter-textual sentiment

	- These two charts show two different forms of users. With the advantage of AI, we can design a unique recommendation algorithm for each user individually, thus ensuring that we have a positive impact on the user's mind, unlike traditional counseling, where the same treatment is usually applied to each patient
